## Page Manager

This is a project created for doing an Operating System Assignement at the University of Technology.
The project required implementing Paging algorithms done in class, two algorithms were required. If it was one algorithm this project wouldn't have been created, but since there two algorithms needed to be implemented I thought it would be best if there was an easy interface to manage the pages instead of manually having to create displays and manage frames and pages.

Algorithms Implemented:
- Clock
- Least Recently Used

Even though the algorithms above are the only ones implemented the Page Manager class of the project allows you to create **your own algorithm** using it's helpful methods.

### Building the Project
All that is required to run this project is to run the `make` command which will run the `Makefile` and build the project. The main function is in `Demo.cpp`

## Contributing

This code is intended to help persons, especially Operating Systems students understand the concepts of paging and to implement their owm paging algorithm if needed. Anyone is free to fork or contribute to this code in anyway, more algorithm implementations, helpful functions, or even a typo fix will be well welcomed.
